    fixed DEBUG flag
    
    use DEBUG flag in the same way in all files. We can now use -DDBUG in the
    compile flag to enable debuggin in compiletime.

    use also SIGTERM to terminate the super loop
    
    currently only the SIGINT is used to terminate the mainloop. Added SIGTERM to
    the signal handler so that we can use common start-stop-daemon to control the
    application without having to use extra signal parameters.

    Switch to autoconf
    
    finally got ridden of ugly handmade Makefiles and switched to autoconf. We need
    a bunch of new files for this now. However we now have autmated package
    building, scripted depedency-checking, parameter controlled cross-compiling
    stuff etc., all kind of goodies one might need or (mostly) not... ;-)

    use 32bit unsigned int instead of 8bit for gpio
    
    Some platforms might have high number for gpio lines, which would extend the
    limit of 255 of uint8, so we switch to uint32 for gpio numbers.

    make runtime configuration possible runtime
    
    We use now libconfuse to read several configuration values and configure the
    stuffs in run time. Threw out the now obsolete config_ctl.h file. One side
    effect is that we cannot use partial initialization all over the place now.
    Instead we have to call memset to fill the arrays with 0 upon initializing.
    Further we have to dynamically allocate some arrays. Fortunatelly most stuffs
    are called while starting up, so there shall be no big performance impacts.

    other information, while the content will be refreshed automatically.

    Fixed offby one, fixed handling for song==NULL
    
    when the name > 80 we append the last byte of buffer with '\0'. However the name
    and title buffer are declared with 80 byte long. The intrestin effect is than
    that when we try to write to new_name[80], the software doesn't segfault,
    instead it writes the null termination into old_title[0], which is place just
    after new_name[79] on the stack. This is a stupid off-by-one error, which
    revealed some really interesting stuff.
    
    Also clear the display buffer if we failed to retrieve a song. This prevents
    segfaults when we failed to connect to a station.

    * don't quit if we can't initialize the ADC, just disable the analog devices
      instead.
    * fixed some error messages.

    split set_gpio_val callback
    
    Especially for controlling the lcd, where we are toggling different gpio lines
    hundreds of times in a second. It's better to keep the fd of the GPIO valud
    entry around, instead of calling open/close every time when we want to access a
    GPIO line. Hence the set_gpio_val callback is splitted into set_gpio_val_by_fd
    and gpio_get_val_fd, which can be called independently. Also made change in the
    lcd callback to make use of the new callbacks. An array of fds needs to be
    created, some addition to close_lcd routine, nothing complicated.
