FIXME!!:
* fix crash while loaded first time after system starts up. This is strange and
  seems to be no timing issue, since delays didn't help. The issue is in libmpd
  and needs more investigation. In the mean time just start the application two
  times after start up..... ;-)

Enhancements:
* add configuration interface, make stuffs runtime-configurable by a
  configuration file
* fix alsa control interface. acutally a toolchain issues since we can't use any
  system native calls like libm or pthread by now.
* AUTOTOOL this shit. The Makefile sucks like hell.
* Add support for play back local music repo, make it switchable.
* Add LED support, everybody loves blinking stuffs.
* some more ....
